# Entropy Stages

### REPORT ANY ISSUES USING THE LINK ABOVE

### THIS MOD WILL CAUSE ISSUES WITH SIMULACRUM

### What is Entropy?

Entropy is a larger mod I'm planning that'll be divided into modules instead of having everything packed together so people can download the parts they want and I can release parts early.

### Known Issues (multiplayer)

- Crystal objective doesn't show up for clients
- Crystals have no collision for clients (but can be destroyed)
- TP crystal effect isn't removed after completion for clients (but can be interacted with)

### Stage Additions

- Simulacrum stages have been reworked and added as side stages like void fields
- There's a 25% chance for a void rift to appear on stages with a simulacrum variant
- The stage will have one-fourth of the interactable credits
- The stage's teleporter will be locked behind crystals
- The stage has extra enemy credits (7.5%) (increased/stronger enemies)
- The stage will have voidtouched elites added to the pool
- Time is NOT stopped on the void stages
- Stage number IS progressed
- 1 void suppressor is guaranteed to spawn in these stages
