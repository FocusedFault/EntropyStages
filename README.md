#### What is Entropy?

Entropy is a larger mod I'm planning that'll be divided into modules instead of having everything packed together so people can download the parts they want.

### Stage Changes

- Simulacrum stages have been added to the regular run pool as "Corrupted" Stages
- Newt is always guaranteed so you can dream for corrupted stages (they'll appear as an empty dream)
- Added a third bazaar seer since the pool is larger now
- Corrupted stages have been added to stage 1-4 pools. S1 +1, S2 +2, S3 +2, S4 +1
- Corrupted stages don't have printers
- Corrupted stages have voidtouched elites in the elite pool
- Corrupted stages have +10% enemy credits
- Corrupted stages have their teleporter locked with 3 time crystals (like prismatic)
