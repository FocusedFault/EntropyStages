### What is Entropy?

Entropy is a larger mod I'm planning that'll be divided into modules instead of having everything packed together so people can download the parts they want and I can release parts early.

### Stage Changes

- Simulacrum stages have been added to the regular run pool as "Corrupted" Stages
- You can dream for corrupted stages at newt (they'll appear as an empty dream)
- Corrupted stages have been added to stage 1-4 pools. S1 +Void Plains, S2 +Void Aphelian/Aqueduct, S3 +Void RPD/Meadow, S4 +Void Abyssal
- Corrupted stages have voidtouched elites in the elite pool
- Corrupted stages have +20% enemy credits
- Corrupted stages have their teleporter locked with 3 time crystals (like prismatic)
- Corrupted stages have a guaranteed void suppressor with a chance for 3 total
